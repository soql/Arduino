## **BlueDot Arduino Libraries**

This library allows the user to program and read the outputs of the BME680 Sensor with an Arduino Board.

DISCLAIMER: This library is still under development and therefore UNFINISHED.
            With this library you are able to read temperature, pressure, humidity and the resistance of the 
            gas sensor sensitive layer from the BME680.
            Currently the library only allows for the I2C communication.
